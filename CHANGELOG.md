## Release 0.3.3
### Sumary
Fixed bad argument in services.

## Release 0.3.2
### Summary
Fixed bad Hiera parameter for home_directories_perm.

## Release 0.3.1
### Summary
Minor modifications to metadata.json to better Puppet Forge score.

## Release 0.3.0
### Summary
Finished manual auditing and testing of the module.  No rspec tests have been done mostly because it's insanely confusing and I don't have the time to work through the process.  If you happen to be good at running these tests, drop me a line because I'd love to work with you through the process.

## Release 0.2.0
### Summary
All critical errors from puppet runs have been corrected. Troubleshooting PAM module still needs to be happen because the config isn't laid down properly. No manual audit validation has been done yet either so there's no guarantee that everything will produce the correct desired state.

## Release 0.1.0
### Summary
First iteration of the cisecurity module.
